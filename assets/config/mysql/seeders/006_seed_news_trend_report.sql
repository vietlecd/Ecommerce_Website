    'Comprehensive report dissecting the two dominant footwear aesthetics for the upcoming season.',
    '<h2>Executive Overview</h2>
     <p>The global footwear market is split between <em>neo heritage</em> (refined throwbacks, premium leather, hand-finished details) and <em>tech utility</em> (futuristic tooling, modular uppers, tactical trims). This report consolidates survey data, designer interviews, and sell-through metrics.</p>
     <h2>Section I &mdash; Consumer Sentiment</h2>
     <p>We interviewed 1,200 shoppers. 58% listed material authenticity as the key reason for choosing heritage silhouettes, while 64% favored tech utility because of weatherproofing and cross-function versatility.</p>

        <li>Gen Z gravitates toward exaggerated lug soles (+32% QoQ searches)</li>
        <li>Millennial professionals continue to rebuild loafer rotations (+18% YoY sales)</li>
        <li>Performance commuters demand reflective panels and quick toggles</li>
     </ul>
