    'Founder Letter: Five Principles Guiding Our Next Chapter',
    'An open letter outlining culture, sustainability, craft, and community commitments for 2025.',
    '<h2>Principle One &mdash; People First</h2>
     <p>We expanded mental health coverage for every retail associate and increased hourly wages by 14%. Transparency reports will be published quarterly.</p>
     <h2>Principle Two &mdash; Radical Craft</h2>
     <p>Each atelier receives free-form R&D hours to experiment. Expect limited micro-batches that champion imperfection.</p>
     <h2>Principle Three &mdash; Planet Positive</h2>
     <ul>
        <li>Solar retrofits in three factories</li>
        <li>Closed-loop leather tanning with 90% recycled water</li>
        <li>Take-back program expanding to 40 markets</li>
     </ul>
     <h2>Principle Four &mdash; Digital Community</h2>
     <p>We launched <strong>ShoeStore Signal</strong>, a members-only feed with behind-the-scenes builds, AR try-ons, and co-design polls.</p>
     <h2>Principle Five &mdash; Education</h2>
     <p>A free 8-week apprenticeship now runs twice a year, pairing students with master cobblers.</p>
     <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>
     <p>As we grow, we anchor every decision to these five points. Hold us accountable and continue sending feedback.</p>',
