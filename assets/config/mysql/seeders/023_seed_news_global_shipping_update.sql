    '<h2>New Routes &amp; Network Optimization</h2>
     <h3>Singapore Direct Hub Launch</h3>
     <p>We opened direct Singapore hubs, trimming delivery times by 3 days and reducing emissions per parcel by 12%. The hub operates 24/7, balancing capacity for Southeast Asia and Oceania. <strong>Live dashboards</strong> show clearance times, giving customers transparency. Regional teams now co-locate with customs officers to fast-track inspections.</p>
     <h3>EU Express Corridors</h3>
     <p>New express lanes connect Rotterdam, Milan, and Warsaw with nightly rail freight. Shipments move under 48 hours doorstep-to-doorstep. <u>Intermodal tracking</u> alerts customers when packages swap modes—rail to van to bike messenger.</p>
     <h3>Resilience Measures</h3>
     <p>We added storm contingency routes and pre-positioned stock in climate-risk zones. Heat maps guide decision-making so weather doesn’t derail service.</p>

     <h2>Packaging Upgrades &amp; Sustainability</h2>
     <h3>Magnet Closures</h3>
     <p>Magnet closures replacing tape improve user experience and keep boxes reusable. Magnets are embedded in cardboard sleeves, recycling easily.</p>
     <h3>Reinforced Corners</h3>
     <p>Reinforced corners for stroller-safe deliveries prevent crush damage. Boxes survive drop tests at 1.5 meters.</p>
     <h3>Plant-Based Inks</h3>
     <p>Plant-based inks for inserts reduce VOCs. QR codes link to recycling tips. <em>Footnotes</em> cite suppliers to maintain transparency.</p>

     <h2>Service Levels &amp; Delivery Options</h2>
     <h3>Weekend Dispatch</h3>
     <p>Express shipping now includes weekend dispatch. Customers in 12 cities get two-hour courier options with live bike GPS tracking.</p>
     <h3>Green Delivery Choices</h3>
     <p>We added eco-slot selection where customers choose consolidated delivery windows to cut emissions.</p>
     <h3>Performance Metrics</h3>
     <p>Delivery success rates publish weekly; any SLA misses trigger credits automatically.</p>

     <h2>Support Enhancements &amp; CX</h2>
     <h3>Unified Queue</h3>
     <p>We merged live chat, SMS, and WhatsApp into a single queue with automatic case syncing, reducing response times to under 3 minutes on average.</p>
     <h3>Proactive Alerts</h3>
     <p>AI monitors routes and pings customers before delays occur, offering reroute options.</p>
     <h3>Self-Service Tools</h3>
     <p>Self-service portal now shows customs status, proof-of-delivery photos, and carbon footprint per order.</p>',
